  "text": "Today's video I'm going to show you how to test your webcam and microphone in Zoom. So let's say you have a meeting planned later on and you want to make sure your webcam is looking okay, you want to see how the background looks and see how you're presenting yourself or if you want to check your microphone works. All you need to do is join a fake meeting. To do so you need to already have Zoom downloaded, installed and you need to be signed up. You go to this website zoom.com slash test and then from there you can join a fake meeting. So you press the join button and then there's an option to launch the meeting so you click that. Then Zoom should open up automatically and then from here you'll be able to see yourself, you'll be able to see which camera is operating. You could maybe change the camera if you have an external webcam. So that gives you that option there. Once you've selected that and everything's okay you can move on to the next step. On the next one you'll hear like a chime and this is basically your speakers being tested. Again you can change the output so it could be maybe through your headphones, it could be through your speakers and then you can also test your microphone here and you can change the microphone. Once you've done all of those things you can end the test and then the meeting will stay on for a bit and then it will automatically close. So that's how to test your webcam and speakers and microphone on Zoom.",
